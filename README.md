plug_p0ne
=========

The All-In-One solution to overhaul the social-music website [plug.dj](https://plug.dj/) with not just autojoin, but also **over a hundred [features](#features)**, [bug-fixes](#bug-fixes), [customizations](#customizations) and [improvements](#improvements). It uses a modular structure that lets you enable/disable every feature individually to fit **your needs**, as well as feature-specific settings.

Right now all old versions of plug_p0ne are being manually reviewed before being pushed to Github, to anything problematic being leaked. This repo can already be used for tracking issues, however you should not rely on the code just yet. (as of September 2016)
