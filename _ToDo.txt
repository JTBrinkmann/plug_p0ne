==== To Do ====
== SUMMARY ==
- Chatlog manager
- options menu
- Playlist Manager

== TEMP ==

== COMPLETE ==
- p0ne.close()
- standard plug.dj script features
	- ETA
	- PM
	- booth alert
	~~ moderators ~~
	- song in history
	- song >10min
	- user info (when joined, how often meh'd)
- separate fimplug.css and p0ne.css
- FIXES
	- remember video stream on/off
	- spinning wheel of death when editing playlists
	- @mentions /me-emotes
- p0ne Bugfixes
	- make plug_p0ne work with Popout Chat (legacyChat & ChatInput)
	- add-icon derps in .history in icon-view
- Options Menu
	- save settings
	- module options
		- replace <toggle> with "<label><input type=checkbox class=checkbox val=...><div class=togglebox><div class=knob></div></div>#{$el .text!}</label>"
			- add listener to save settings
	- advanced options (hide tech-savy options by default)
- Fixes
	- fix no-playlist-update
		- test if works
	- improve no-leave
		- in the require with .execute, the .onError sends you to "/" on auth-error
- Custom Avatars
	- only send change:avatarID for users in the same room
	- emit changed:room events
	- throttle avatarID changes
- Chat
	- fix emoticons like :<3
	// - instead of rendering messages by the user twice (once when pending, once when received) only move (animated) pending messages and add CID
	// - make it NOT entirely based on t.message, as it might be different (@mentions get wrapped, other scripts like plugCubed convert inline-images, …)
	- have better compatibility for inline images by other scripts (e.g. plug³'s)
		- without disabling p³'s setting
	- warn on posting messages that won't go through
		- links directly after join (as an alternative to linkHax)
	- allow quoting messages
		- add #123456-654321 to send messages
		- replace #\d+-\d+ with a quote of responding messages (preferably in a Skype-like fashion)
	- fix notifications on messages that are @someoneElse, but who's name starts with yours ("@https" shouldn't trigger a notification for @http)
- Chat-inline-Images
	- apply to messages loaded before chatScript
	- collapse long images
	- filter images by tags
	- add Media-Options to youtube and soundcloud links
		- requires superpowered grab()
- superpower grab()
	- add media by URL
	- maybe there's a way to convert CIDs to IDs
	- might need to use search() to get the data required for grabbing
	- add playlist:update event
- Autocomplete
	- avoid lookup if searchstring is known to fail
		- e.g. don't look up :emotes: in the string "http://ddg.gg/ cursor is ->|<- here" because of preceding :
		- cache last search and insta-return no results if the current search begins with previous, and if previous didn't had any results either
	- !disable
	- add a max-width (with linebreaks)
		… maybe even marquee on hover/select
	- !botcommands (requires custom room socket)
	- for @Bot !commands, check if @Bot is online
	- plug³'s twitch emotes (would ideally require TAT to make the twitchEmotes variable globally accessible)
- Chat notfications / Media-Options
	# - make .song-stats icons dynamically look up the icons.###.png
	- show .song-stats for lastPlay
	- add an automute button
	- add a ruleskip button
	- add a  download button?
	- replace grab button with remove button if song is already in a playlist
		- listen on playlist:update event
	- fix search-artist function
- Ponymotes
	- after adding the message, check if it's wider than the chat (328px) and adjust its size.
	- add CSS .bpm-emote {max-width: 100%} (do NOT add bg-size: contain! it breaks most ponymotes)
- Song-Info
	- play stats (first played, …)
		- nice little graph with dots?
	- tags (WD-only, PMV)

		- fix dynamic look up
		- compress the CSS: set "background" property of all .from's and only change the -position

- Moderation Helper
	- warn on new users before their play
	- evaluate users
		- check for pony terms in their name & previous chat
		- check if previously in the room
		- check if previously skipped / played pony
		- check joinDate
		- check play-history (using profile)
	- evaluate songs
		- check if previously played in the room
		- check who played it first (e.g. if by Pacman than likely accepted)
