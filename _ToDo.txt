==== To Do ====
== SUMMARY ==
- Chatlog manager
- options menu
- fix module updating (it's VERY broken)
- Playlist Manager

== COMPLETE ==
- Chat
	- http://www.bronyland.com/emoticon-guide/
	- show country icon in #user-rollover
	- instead of rendering messages by the user twice (once when pending, once when received) only move (animated) pending messages and add CID
	- make it NOT entirely based on t.message, as it might be different (@mentions get wrapped, other scripts like plugCubed convert inline-images, …)
	- have better compatibility for inline images by other scripts (e.g. plug³'s)
		- without disabling p³'s setting
	- warn on posting messages that won't go through
		- links directly after join (as an alternative to linkHax)
	- allow quoting messages
		- add #123456-654321 to send messages
		- replace #\d+-\d+ with a quote of responding messages (preferably in a Skype-like fashion)
	- fix notifications on messages that are @someoneElse, but who's name starts with yours ("@https" shouldn't trigger a notification for @http)
- Chat-inline-Images
	- apply to messages loaded before chatScript
	- collapse long images
	- filter images by tags
	- add Media-Options to youtube and soundcloud links
		- requires superpowered grab()
- superpower grab()
	- add media by URL
	- maybe there's a way to convert CIDs to IDs
	- might need to use search() to get the data required for grabbing
- Autocomplete
	- avoid lookup if searchstring is known to fail
		- e.g. don't look up :emotes: in the string "http://ddg.gg/ cursor is ->|<- here" because of preceding :
		- cache last search and insta-return no results if the current search begins with previous, and if previous didn't had any results either
	- !disable
	- add a max-width (with linebreaks)
		… maybe even marquee on hover/select
	- !botcommands (requires custom room socket)
	- for @Bot !commands, check if @Bot is online
	- plug³'s twitch emotes (would ideally require TAT to make the twitchEmotes variable globally accessible)
- Chat notfications / Media-Options
	# - make .song-stats icons dynamically look up the icons.###.png
	- only show .song-stats for lastPlay and show .song-notif etc for nextPlay
		- show collapsed .song-notif for lastPlay
	- add an automute button
	- add a  download button?
	- replace grab button with remove button when song is already in a playlist
- Ponymotes
	- after adding the message, check if it's wider than the chat (328px) and adjust its size.
	- add CSS .bpm-emote {max-width: 100%} (do NOT add bg-size: contain! it breaks most ponymotes)

- PerformanceEnhancements
	- animate avatars
	- fix icon CSS
		- fix dynamic look up
		- compress the CSS: set "background" property of all .from's and only change the -position
- ?BB
	- improve timeout
		- somethingsomething per user
		- timeout becomes exponentially larger
	- make ?BB check what CIDs each send message has
		- add a "?blame #chat-id" command, to find out who/what triggered a message send by ?BB with the specified CID

- etc
	- warn on/fix not working join-waitlist
	- show userlist when hovering the woot/grab/meh button (showing who wooted/grabed/meh'd)
	- add alert-on-mention / alert-on-all / alert-off button
	- when Stream is off, show a note on the #playback container and an Stream-enable-button
	- make the reload-button on the "disconnected" popup just reconnect to the sockets instead of reloading the page
	- indicate new point-mileages (e.g. "Octavia has reached 800 fans")
	- highlight messages by specific user / show messages by alts with .me class (or similar)
	- waitlist ETA
	- queue meh when just joined
	- show played-###-ago next to songs in the playlist
	- avoid history plays
	- if autowooted and many people start to meh, automeh to avoid blocking voteskips with autowoot
	- fix unmuting after previewing songs
	- fix previewing popup blocking the chat

- requires custom room socket
	- load chat
	- custom avatars
	- audio-only streams
	- !botcommand autocomplete
